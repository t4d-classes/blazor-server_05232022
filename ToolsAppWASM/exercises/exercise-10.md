# Exercise 10

1. Move the car data table row to its own component named Car View Row. Notice the name is singular.

2. Utilize the new Car View Row component in Car Table to display the car data rows.

3. Add a column to the table with a column header labeled "Actions".

4. In the new column "Actions" of the Car View Row component place a button labeled with "Delete".

5. When the Delete button is clicked, remove the car row from the table.

6. If all cars are deleted, then display a message that says "There are no cars." as the only data row of the table.

Ensure it works!
