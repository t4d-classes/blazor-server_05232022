# Exercise 4

1. Implement the append and replace operations for the cars endpoint.

The replace operation is a PUT request as shown:

PUT /v1/colors/2

{
  "id": 2,
  "name:"green",
  "hexcode: "00FF00"
}

2. Implement the code with error handling, metadata and using tasks.

3. Verify both operations work in Swagger.
