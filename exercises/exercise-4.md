# Exercise 4

1. In this exercise, the Car Form from the previous exercise will be upgraded.

2. For the year, write a custom validator that requires the year to be at least the year the car was invented.

4. For the price, validate that the value is at least 0 dollars. You may use the built-in `Range` validator or a custom validator.

5. If validation fails, display a validation summary and a validation message next to the fields.

6. When the form is submitted add the car to the table.

7. Ensure it works.
