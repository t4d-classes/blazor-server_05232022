# Exercise 5

1. Display the Screen Blocker on Car Tool whenever the cars are retrieved from the database.

2. Display a `window.alert` when a car is added.

Bonus: Wrap the `window.alert` in a service similar to the screen blocker.

3. Update the Color Tool and Car Tool pages to set the title of the HTML document when those page components are loaded. For Color Tool, set the title to "Color Tool". For Car Tool, set the title to "Car Tool". In .NET 5 there is no easy way to configure the title (such as the .NET 6 `PageTitle` component). So you will need to write some custom JavaScript and call it from Blazor.

Bonus: Create your own `PageTitle` component that wraps the call to JavaScript to set the title.

4. Ensure it works!
